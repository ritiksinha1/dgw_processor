# This script automates the verification process when updating the requirement_blocks table after a
# new dataset is downloaded from Tumbleweed. The verification process consists of determining
# whether any previously-quarantined blocks have been fixed and whether any new blocks fail to
# parse cleanly.

# The report_progress function sends email to the operations director to let them know what's
# happening.

# Generate Test Data
#    This step makes copies of all the requirement_blocks as files, distributing them into test_data
#    folders with suffixes according to their block types. The ../quarantine_list.csv file is used
#    to partition previously-quarantined blocks into the test_data.quarantine folder.

# Check Quarantined Blocks
#    Here, we try to parse the previously-quarantined blocks. Any blocks that now parse correctly

# Investigate Timeouts
#    Timeouts are blocks that take a long time to parse. The problem could be either that the block
#    is really complex or that there is an error in the grammar. During the Run Tests stage, blocks
#    that fail to parse within a certain time limit (3 minutes by default) were identified, and this
#    step tries just those blocks again with a longer time limit (10 minutes by default).

# All Done
#    Report all parsing and timeout errors for manual review. The quarantine.sh script can be run to

# Developerâ€™s Guide
#   I use the following variables, aliases, and function, defined in my ~/.aliases_du_jour, to
#   facilitate manual review of anomalies:
#     Get into the testing directory
#       export testing="$PROJS_DIR/dgw_processor/testing"
#       alias testing='cd "$testing"'
#     Copy the name of a test_data.{block_type} file to the system clipboard, and use the following
#     commands to set the TEST_DATA environment variable, and to copy it to/from the temporary file
#     named t.
#       alias setit='export TEST_DATA=$TEST_DIR/`pbpaste`*'
#       alias tot='export saved_t=$TEST_DATA; cp $TEST_DATA ./t; export TEST_DATA=./t'
#       alias fromt='export TEST_DATA=$saved_t'
#     Edit the offending block to locate the problem. (subl is an alias for the programming editor
#     that I use.)
#       alias sublt='subl t'
#     View the test_data and test_results folders
