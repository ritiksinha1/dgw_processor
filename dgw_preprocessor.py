        From Scribe Language Users Guide:
        The trick to knowing where the place the commas when using Hide (from advice) is to be sure
        that everything within and including the braces can be removed leaving a valid, parseable
        course rule.
        # Hide ECON 112 from the advice
         3 Classes in ACCT 103, 105, {Hide ECON 112,} 114
          Label ACCOUNTING "Accounting Requirements";
        # Hide MATH 104 from the advice
         3 Credits in MATH 184, {HideFromAdvice MATH 104 (WITH DWTerm < 201230)}
           Label MATH "Math Requirement";
        # Show HIST 184 but hide the WITH information
         5 Credits in HIST 184 (WITH Hide DWResident = Y)
           Label HIST "History Requirement";

        But Note that the hide clause can be inside a with-clause or group enclosed in parentheses
        instead of curly quotes, or an area enclosed in square brackets.

        Other observation: if all the courses in an area are hidden, you can end up with an empty
        area. Likewise, you can end up with a class/credit requirement where the course list ends up
        missing. And handling hidden groups means dealing with OR before, after, or neither of the
        parens.

        Further note, that a course can satisfy a requirement even if it is hidden, so the mapper
        should see them anyway.

        So this feature is not implemented at this time
